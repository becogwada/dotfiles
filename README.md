# Dotfiles 
These are my dotfiles. Inspired by http://dotfiles.github.io/. Feel free to clone / fork. This is a work in progress. Let me know if you find any issues, or have any other cool options / sripts to add.

## Warning 
Please read the scripts before using as they may contain things you don't want. Specifically, the osx_defaults.sh script will change you machine name, etc to markle976 - you probably don't want that! So, edit the files first. Also, beware that the dotfiles in src will be copied to your home directory and could potentially overwrite any setting you have there.

## What's included 

### osx_defaults 
Running this script will set OSX options for you. Depending on which version of OSX you are running these may not all work, but running it won't break anything if the option no longer exists.  
### src/install.sh 
These are dotfiles that can be used to modify your terminal settings (colors, git, etc). You can copy them one by one, or run install.sh which will automatically copy them to your home directory.

### sublime 
This directory contains my favorite text editor font (install manually by double clicking, etc), and a script to replace the default Sublime Text 2 icon with a better looking one.
